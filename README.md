# BenchmarkHistory

The library provides tools for keeping a log of running time and memory
allocation of functions to be benchmarked. I use this library together with
buildbot to be alerted when one of my programs or libraries performs much worse
due to recent changes. The system uses the history of benchmark runs to adapt
to changes.
